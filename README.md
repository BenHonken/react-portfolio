## Description

This is a portfolio by Ben Honken.  It was converted from an html page to a react app.  The home page tells a bit about me.  The portfolio page displays several projects I have worked on.  Each picture is a link to the deployed version, and the links below lead to the github repository.  The contact page has my contact info for prospective employers.

## Usage

As an aspiring developer, I want to have a clean, impressive portfolio that is responsive and easy to navigate so that employers can easily survey my work and realize how great it would be to hire me.  

## Credits

Ben Honken made this.
